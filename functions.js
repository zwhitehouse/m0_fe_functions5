// Defining Our Own Functions
// For each exercise below, write the function according to the requirements. 
// Call each method at least twice and store the return value in a variable. 
// Use console.log() to see the return value in the console.

// 1: Write a function named greeting that returns a string with a general greeting. 


// 2: Write a function named customGreeting that returns a greeting WITH a specific name.


// 3: Write a function named greetPerson that takes in 3 strings, a first, middle, and last name, and returns a sentence with the full name.


// 4: Write a function named square that takes in one number, and returns the square of that number.
// BONUS: Print a sentence that interpolates the return value of your square function.


// 5: Write a function named checkStock that satisfies the following interaction pattern:

checkStock(4, "Coffee");
// => "Coffee is stocked"

checkStock(3, "Tortillas");
// => "Tortillas - running LOW"

checkStock(0, "Cheese");
// => "Cheese - OUT of stock!"

checkStock(1, "Salsa");
// => "Salsa - running LOW"

// Hint: You will only write one checkStock function that checks the quantity and then prints the corresponding statement.
